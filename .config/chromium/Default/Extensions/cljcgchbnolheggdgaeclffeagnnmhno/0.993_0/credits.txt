I wanted to use this file to attribute some js and icon files.

This code uses jqplot for charting. It is an excellent chart library. Check it out at jqplot.com !

The icon was obtained from the icon set at http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/23/friday-freebies-flavours-icon-set-and-cute-tweeters-icon-set/ .
